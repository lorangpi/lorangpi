Hi, I'm Pierrick, I aspire to teach robots on how to navigate and respond effectively in a dynamically changing environment.

I’m currently working on Neurosymbolic Techniques for agents to accomodate open-world scenarios. I’m always eager to collaborate with peers on similar research topics. Reach me via email (pierrick.lorang@gmail.com / pierrick.lorang@tufts.edu)
